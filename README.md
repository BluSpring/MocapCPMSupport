# Mocap CPM Support
Brings support for [Customizable Player Models](https://modrinth.com/plugin/custom-player-models) into the [Motion Capture](https://modrinth.com/mod/motion-capture) mod.
Originally commissioned and created for the Artoria SMP's 4th Anniversary Event.

This mod should only be required on the server-side, and it will hook into Motion Capture to detect and transmit if the tracked
player has any CPM data attached, and will also track any emotes and toggles the player uses.

Requires:
- Fabric Language Kotlin
- Fabric API
- Motion Capture
- Customizable Player Models
